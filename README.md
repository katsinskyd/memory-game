## 52-Card Memory Game

### Rules
Click on cards to flip them  
Matching a pair adds points to your total score equal to the value of the cards times the score multiplier    
Matching the same suit/color in a row adds a point to the score multiplier, so try to get a good combo!  
  
Non-numbered card values:  
A = 1    
J = 11  
Q = 12  
K = 13
