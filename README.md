## 52-Card Memory Game
That's 104 cards total! (For now. 104 is a lot)

### Rules
Click on cards to flip them  
Matching a pair adds points to your total score equal to the value of the cards times the score multiplier    
Matching the same suit in a row adds a point to the score multiplier, so try to get a good combo!  
  
Non-numbered card values:  
A = 1    
J = 11  
Q = 12  
K = 13  

### Features in Development/Ideas
- Single deck mode (match hearts with diamonds and clubs with spades) (52 Cards)
- Ability to change card & background colors
- Ability to change difficulty (lose points for a number of consecutive misses)
- Congratulations screen on winning
- High score display
- Make it look better overall and fix CSS issues
- Neat animations
